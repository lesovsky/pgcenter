#### General notes
- run pgCenter on the same host with Postgres, otherwise some features will not work, e.g. config editing, logfile view.
- run pgCenter using database `SUPERUSER` account, e.g. postgres. Some kind of stats aren't available for unprivileged accounts.
- Connections established to Postgres are managed by [jackc/pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx/) driver which supports [.pgpass](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-pgpass.html) and most of common libpq [environment variables](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-envars.html), such as PGHOST, PGPORT, PGUSER, PGDATABASE, PGPASSWORD, PGOPTIONS.

#### Download
Download the latest release from [release page](https://github.com/lesovsky/pgcenter/releases), install using package manager or unpack from `.tar.gz` archive. Now, pgCenter is ready to run.

#### Run in Docker
There is option to run pgCenter using Docker. Docker images available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/lesovsky/pgcenter).
```
docker pull lesovsky/pgcenter:latest
docker run -it --rm lesovsky/pgcenter:latest pgcenter top -h 1.2.3.4 -U user -d production_db
```

#### pgCenter usage
pgCenter's functionality is splitted among several sub-commands, run specific one to achieve your goals.
In most cases, connection setting can be omitted.

- Run `top` command to connect to Postgres and watching statistics:
    ```
    pgcenter top -h 1.2.3.4 -U postgres production_db
    ```

- Run `profile` command to connect to Postgres and profile backend with PID 12345:
    ```
    pgcenter profile -U postgres -P 12345 production_db
    ```

- Run `profile` command to profile backend with PID 12345 with frequency 50 (every 20ms):
    ```
    pgcenter profile -U postgres -P 12345 -F 50 production_db
    ```

- Run `record` command to connect to Postgres, poll statistics and continuously save to a local file:
    ```
    pgcenter record -f /tmp/stats.tar -U postgres production_db
    ```

- Run `report` command to read the previously written file and build a report:
    ```
    pgcenter report -f /tmp/stats.tar --databases
    ```

- Run `report` command, build activity report with start time 12:30:00 and end time 12:50:00:
    ```
    pgcenter report --activity --start 12:30:00 --end 12:50:00
    ```
    
- Run `report` command, build tables report order by `seq_scan` column and show only 2 tables per single stat snapshot:
    ```
    pgcenter report --tables --order seq_scan --limit 2
    ```
- Run `report` command, build statements report and show statements that have `UPDATE` word in `query` column:
    ```
    pgcenter report --statements m --grep query:UPDATE
    ```
    
Full list of available parameters available in a built-in help for particular command, use `--help` parameter.

```
pgcenter report --help
```
